I have developed multiple backend applications using Spring Boot focusing on real-world business problems such as task management, product inventory, movie catalog systems, and event registration platforms. These projects helped me gain strong knowledge in REST API development, JPA/Hibernate, in-memory and relational databases, and application architecture.

I worked on implementing CRUD operations, entity relationships, service-layer business logic, and scheduled background jobs. I also practiced database schema management using Flyway migrations and built scalable backend structures following industry standards like Controller → Service → Repository architecture.

My projects demonstrate hands-on experience in building secure, modular, and maintainable backend systems using Spring Boot.
